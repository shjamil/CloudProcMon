# CloudProcMon
CloudProcMon is a non intrusive cloud monitoring solution. 
This project is based on OpenStack based cloud. Three bash files provided can be used either as Nagios plugin to fetch monitoring information or can be used as standalone code to fetch data and to feed some personalized monitoring dashboard. These bash codes will be deployed on Cloud Compute Node, as they collected data from host machine OS.
